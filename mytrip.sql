Head South along a dirt road known as Pedra Queimada and follow the waymarks until you reach the regional road.\n\nContinue by walking parallel to the road, enjoying the view over the North Coast, village of Maia, Ponta Formosa and Ponta do Cintrao.\n\nProceed along the trail downwards by the Lajinha way, among agricultural fields until you reach the road again - Rua do Rosario - with the fountain Velha on your right (spring water).\n\nContinue towards the centre until you arrive at the bathing area of Calhau da Areia - by taking the connection to PR 27 SMI Praia da Viola. Follow the waymarks passing the viewpoint of Melo Nunes where it is possible to access a rocky area.\n\nThe trail continues along the coast, passing the viewpoint of Frade. Along the way you will go through ETAR and cross the bridge over Ribeira da Cruz. Further ahead there is a detour to the right that will take you to natural swimming pools.\n\nKeep on going on the dirt road until the regional road and turn left towards the centre of the village.

We come soon to a wide path, which is probably thought for dogsled, and we go left. Wild parrots, Cachanas, are screeching over our heads. At the next sign that marks the Laguna, we leave the forest and we get our first nice view of the Sierra Alvear. On the right, we find the way to the Cafeteria, but we turn left and cross a stream on a wide wooden bridge. After a bit of walk through the forest, we reach a wide high moor. The trail becomes always more and more swampier, branches and bridges help to cross the worst passages. It is now steeper and goes through the old Lenga forest. From the next high moor on, the road goes along the rushing glacial stream. At the end of the valley, a long rocky wall blocks the flow of the river and behind you find the dammed up Laguna Esmeralda. The view becomes more beautiful step by step. After about 1,5 hours, there is the sea below us. On the beach, you find amazing places for a picnic. Those who want to walk more, could follow the path on the right from the Laguna. After 2 hours of walking on that route, you will reach the Glaciar del Albino.

As soon as you leave the subway, you will be approached by taxi drivers offering a ride to Kazbegi. They usually charge 100-120 GEL, the best price we were ever able to haggle was 75 GEL for five people. The main advantage of a taxi is the possibility to make breaks at various sights along the highway such as Ananuri fortress, Friendship monument or travertines behind Jvari pass. Road itself is magnificent, so it''s worth it to pay a taxi, at least for the first time. \nIf you are not interested in a taxi, you can look for a marshrutka - they depart when full from 8. am till late afternoon. The trip takes 3 hours and costs 10 GEL.', 'http://someforeignguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/g2.jpg'),

The view over the colorful mountains is a real highlight on every trip to South America.\n\nIf you are unlucky, it can happen that you can not see the colorful colors because of snowfall. However, this happens only very rarely.\n\nAltogether about 700 meters of altitude are climbed and then descended again. At the highest point at about 5100 m, you have a wonderful view over the colorful mountains of Rainbow Mountain.\n\nThe path leads through a valley up to the ridge and from there to the highest vantage point. On the way you can watch wild alpaca herds grazing.\n\nThe hike is technically not very demanding, the only challenge is the height. If you have problems with this, you can reach the summit in an emergency on mules that are on the way all the way.

These distinctive rock formations rise above the water and will take your breath away.\n\nIf you want to go for a walk along the route, you shouldn''t miss the chance to take a look at Great Ocean Walk.

The bus will continue left towards Chugchilan, but you will walk into town. Alternatively, you can make the three-hour direct drive from Quito. There''s a wonderful hotel directly across from the entrance to the Quilotoa Lake called Hostal Chukirawa. Sitting at such a high altitude, altitude sickness prevention pills are recommended. Also, the town is foggy and cold - bring a warm jacket, and make sure that your hotel will be warm (such as a fireplace in your room and warm down blankets).', 'http://www.cretertours.com.ec/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/QUILOTA.jpg'),
